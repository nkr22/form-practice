/* two ways to export module world
default or the name of the function (that must be both imported and exported that way)*/

//no curly braces required for the default

//cohesion: you want high cohesion
//coupling: you want low coupling

/*

is this function like that function? do they use the same data?
syntax is more straightforward than IIFE's
it is not more power, they just do their job differently

this binding: when using new, it binds it to the new object you pass to the function or class constructor.
SAY NEW!!!

when to use new
1. when creating an instance of a user-defined object type
2. or when you are creating an instance of a built-in object types that has a constructor function
    - EX: String (not Math)

constructor functions: use capital letters at the starts

JSLint: expects to see Object.create(null) instead of the new operator

CSS
Specificity and Inheritance

Style Precedence:
    -some styles propagate via inheritance (for example, background-color)
    -other styles do not: padding, border, margin, etc.

What is ">" in a CSS mean? It means that you are defining he parent element

","s are an or

replaced vs nonreplaced element
    -replace gets its display content from outside source (img)
    -most elements are nonreplaced, content is displayed in nbox generated by element itself

Float: if it is a nonreplaced element, you have to give it a width
    - if you are flowing text around something, you need to know how much space to give it

Static: Normal
Relative: Offset from normal, elements positioned relative to box
Absolute: removed from normal document flow, positioned within its containing box
Fixed: Positioned with respect to viewport

when you have an element that you have made position relative- NOW anything positioned with absolute inside of the relative container
will be inside the container

Relative unit: em and px
- em is respect to current element, rem is respect to the root element in your document
Others; rem, ex, ch, vw- viewport width unit, vh- viewport height unit, vmin=min(vw, vh), vmax=max(vw, vh)

BEST PRACTICES
Points: font sizes
Em-sizes: layout elements related to textual content- size, some positioning, padding, margins
pixels for everything else
